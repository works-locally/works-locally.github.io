# <img src="./favicon.svg" alt="Logo" width="40" height="40" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> What is Works Locally?

**Works Locally** is a small collection of apps and experiments built with one simple idea:
build useful software quickly, locally, and for the joy of making things.

With the rise of **AI-driven coding agents** and modern developer tools, I can rapidly build and deploy:
- small web applications,
- practical mobile apps,
- fun little desktop tools,
- or just random ideas-because why not? :)

The idea for Works Locally came to me while I was sitting in a hospital, tending to my mom. I had a laptop, an internet connection, and access to an **LLM-based coding agent**. With nothing else to do, I started building.

Within a few hours, I had a decently polished mobile app: **[Pain Recorder](/pain-recorder)** — an offline pain-tracking app focused on privacy and simplicity.

Works Locally is where these kinds of projects live.

# Who Am I?

I’m Nishant—an experienced **independent full-stack software engineer**.

Over the years, I’ve worked across:
- backend systems and APIs,
- front-end web applications,
- DevOps and cloud infrastructure,
- mobile app development,
- and a few now-forgotten big data technologies.

Today, I enjoy building **professional, focused software products** — especially tools that work offline, respect user privacy, and solve real problems without unnecessary complexity.
